# MyLocal.Farm

The source code for the mylocal.farm application.

# Development

We're in a throwaway prototyping phase.

1. Commit to throwing it away (not evolving it).
2. Work as fast as possible... barf on the page.
3. Know that the rebuild will take at least 10x as long as the prototype.

We're doing trunk based development. Commit and push to master daily (or more frequently).

Get started: 

1. Install dotnet core. 
2. `git clone git@github.com:mylocalfarm/mylocalfarm.git`
3. `cd farm-land-lassange`
4. `dotnet run`
